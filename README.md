# code-refactor

## Description

My motivation was to refactor the code to create a more efficient webpage as well as fix a couple of bugs.
I created multiple classes in CSS to represent similiar themes throughout the code.
I also changed numerous non-semantic elements to semantic. 
I inserted "alt" attributes to define alternative text description for graphics. 
From this project I learned, how to incorporate the correct semantic elements. How to effeciently create classes in CSS to represent common themes throughtout the webpage and make the code more effecient.
